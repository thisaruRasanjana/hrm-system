"""
app/core/rate_limit.py
======================
Lightweight in-process rate limiter for sensitive auth endpoints
(login, 2FA, OTP send/verify, password reset) to blunt brute-force attacks.

It uses a fixed-window counter keyed by (scope, client-IP). This has no external
dependencies (no Redis) which keeps local dev and single-process deployments
simple. NOTE: state lives in the worker's memory, so with multiple worker
processes each worker enforces the limit independently. For a hardened
multi-worker/multi-host deployment, swap `_HITS` for a shared store (Redis).

Usage (FastAPI dependency factory):

    from app.core.rate_limit import rate_limit

    @router.post("/login", dependencies=[Depends(rate_limit("login", limit, window))])
    def login(...): ...

or call the guard directly inside a handler:

    enforce_rate_limit(request, "login", limit, window)
